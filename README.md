# Vyapar | व्यापार 

  ### LIVE URL - [https://vyapar-final.netlify.app/]
  ## Notice - Live URL doesn't work anymore as most cloud is costly and i dont wanna waste money for live server. So netlify may still work but backend is not there
  
  This project was bootstrapped with Vite

## Setup instruction - for backend

In the project directory, open 'api' folder :

NOTE - The env variables are right now pushed cause local setup doesn't really hold anything secret, you just need to edit out your mongo db url for local machine
### `npm i`
Install the necessary dependency

### `node seed.js`
This seeds the db with some data so you can use the app

### 'npm start'
Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

## Setup instruction - for frontend


### `npm i`
Install the necessary dependency

### `npm run dev`
Run the app

### `npm run build`
Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) to view it in your browser.
